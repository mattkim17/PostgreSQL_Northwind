# PostgreSQL_Northwind
To practice PostgreSQL, I used the Northwind dataset which is a dataset of a small fictional company. It includes customer information, shipping info, product info, orders, and more. I attached the queries to answer the questions below and an excel file with each query output. 


#Questions to answer 
1. What products did the customer buy? What was his/her name and how much of each product did he/she buy? On what day? 
2. Who are the best employees in terms of sales? 
3.
